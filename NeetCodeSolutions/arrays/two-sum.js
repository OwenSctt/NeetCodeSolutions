     * Problem: Two Sum
     * Difficulty: Easy
     * URL: https://neetcode.io/problems/two-sum
     * 
     * Description:
     * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
     * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
     * You can return the answer in any order.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through array
     * Space Complexity: O(n) - for the hash map
     * 
     * @param {number[]} nums - Array of integers
     * @param {number} target - Target sum
     * @return {number[]} - Array containing the two indices
